# Clinic Flow: Doctor View Code

## Purpose
Enable fast review of patient context before/at consultation.

## Steps for clinic staff
1. Ask patient for health pass code.
2. Open app link: `/doctor-view/<code>`.
3. Review patient basics:
- Age, sex, region
- Conditions and allergies
4. Review recent triage entries:
- Symptoms
- Severity and duration
- Red flags
- Guidance source and recommendation
5. Record quick doctor rating:
- Useful / Not useful

## Operational notes
- Code validity: 30 minutes
- Expired codes must be regenerated by patient
- Use this as support context, not final diagnosis
